# Sentiment_analyser_LS_finalProject
A Sentiment Analysis App Using Gradio and Hugging Face
Fine tuned a pretrained model from hugging face and deployed it through gradio Web interface

The difficulties I faced:
1.Fine tuning took too long for training, So was not able to run the full code at once due to network disturbance
2.Was not able to install some dependencies in visual studio code, So I switched to Google colab, this increased the time for fine tuning little more
